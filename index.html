        Reading has been an integral part of me since childhood. With no internet or even television at times, books have been my go-to medium to escape mundane routine and keep my imagination alive. In recent years, after getting busy with graduate school life, changing jobs and life in general, I lost my connect with it. This was started as an attempt to rekindle that habit as part of a new-year resolution of completing 20 books in 2019 (I completed only 8.... tch tch). I intend to keep this page updated with my reading expoits and ramblings about it.

     We are back to self-help ! And this time I am gonna go through what I have seen is the favorite book of a lot productivity-focused youtubers. I have been following the author’s instagram handle for a while and found a lot of his stuff pretty good. If the book lives up to its hype, I’ll probably write a lot of notes in hope to revisit it. Excited about a self-help book after a long time. Let’s do this..

     Genre: Non-fiction, Cultural, Economics<br>
     I have been meaning to read a book on India for a while now. After leaving India 3 years ago, I have seen the good and bad of it from a cosmopolitan perspective. While I agree anything and everything is political, I want to understand the tense struggle playing out between equality and privilege in my own country from a new perspective. This is a hard-to-get book and it took 3 weeks for them to ship it over. Hopefully it's worth the wait ~.
     <br>
     <br>     
     <b>Update:</b> Well well. That was an excellent book. I am not used to reading such books (blame all the exciting fiction page turners) so this was a more cerebral experience. The book is like a collection of essays detailing India's economy, corruption, billionares, politics, cricket, mainstream media and position at the world stage through the eyes of a foreign corrospondent. It focuses especially on the economy of India and its development path from 1991 to around 2010. Overall I found it very riveting and learnt a lot many things that I had to separately look up, such as the 1991 reforms that ended the closed central planning economy and India re-opened itself to the world of industrialization and rapid urbanization. I haven't learnt any of this in my school which mostly consisted of pre-independence history with British and Mughals. Reading books of development of India post independence is something I think everyone in India should do to understand the country's dynamics better. The comparisons with Robber barrons of USA or Russian oligarchs provide a benchmark to measure the rise of billionare class and reflect on its dynamics with the government and changing fortunes of the country. While reading, I gave up a lot of times than I would care to admit as numerous things happened in my personal life and I wasn't always following up on reading (#lazy). It is one of the reasons it took me 8 months to finish it. But looking back I am happy I stuck with it and completed it. Trying new genres is tough and time-consuming but I am happy this book has opened up a new world of social commentary books that I can dive into.

     Genre: Social, Anti-war<br>
     I got to know about Kurt Vonnegut recently through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOGru_4z1Vc">youtube video</a> where he explains different kinds of stories. I was very intrigued with his nihilistic and humorous style. I needed a simple book to read after the previous self-help book and this book of his, seemed like a good fit. A book about search for meaning and purpose of life ? Count me in.
     <br>
     <br>     
     <b>Update:</b> Well that was a highly engrossing book. I wouldn’t say I have totally understood all the underlying themes of it after reading the entire book and watching 2 video essays on it. Because it is a book filled with so much of human emotions that are really hard to describe. It is funny and delightful and sad at the same time. I always love reading different perspectives on the World wars and this perspective is now itched on my mind. I wasn’t aware that the destruction of Dresden, which author survived, was even worse than the all-time famous examples of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, tries to make sense of what he survived through and it is not an easy task without coming across as crazy. The story involves alien abduction, time-travel, war-time atrocities and a poignant look back on all that happened with dry nihilistic humor. The Tralfamadorians reminded me of aliens in  Hitchhiker’s guide to galaxy, described in a funny manner but with social commentary itched in it. The similarity between them and the germans, from the protagonist’s point of view, helps put together the meaning behind the plot. Apparently there’s a 1972 film on it and I plan to watch it sometime. Loved the book overall and definitely a highlight in my reading journey.

     Genre: Finance, Self-Help<br>
     As I have developed a hobby of investing in stock market during the last few months in quarantine, money has been on my mind a lot. Learning about money and its role in life, especially in early stages of my career, sounds like an interesting proposition. I recently purchased an apple pencil so I am excited to read a book on ipad with the pencil's annotation features. Let's give it a try.
     <br>
     <br>     
     <b>Update:</b> This might be the first self-help book I have not rushed through and have taken time to completely absorb. The book is great and has lots of gem of advices, in terms of financial aptitude and planning. I liked how it is not about *Do X and get Y* kind of stuff. A major part of book is focused on the approach towards investing, preset notions about money in our mind, common ignorance around wealth-building and psyche behind risk management. I loved the idea of *Do not avoid risk altogether but learn to manage it*. The book tries to explain the differences between an asset and a liability and how to identify one. Sometimes author comes off a bit self absorbed with over-the-top and debatable ideas, but those are few in number. The author himself made a lot of money during the real-estate boom in US and not all his advices translate literally to other fields. I would not recommend the book to anyone looking for actionable concrete advices but for what its worth, I found the the financial literacy and motivational parts highly helpful. I would say, for a beginner like me, this was an excellent read. Since I read it on iPad with apple pencil, I have some notes I can refer to, from time to time. I would highly recommend getting the pencil if you are into note-taking. Overall, I think its a good read.

     Genre: Self-Help<br>
     It has been a while since I have read a self-help book. I think we all could use some, in these trying times of the pandemic. I have been more self-reflective these days due to so much of work-from-home situation and this book should fit in that philosophy nicely ~!
     <br>
     <br>     
     <b>Update:</b> The book is short and concise. It is just 130 pages long but I read it with breaks to understand what it had to offer. The author provides 4 rules to live by which are the cornerstone of Toltec wisdom, namely: Be Impeccable With Your Word, Don't Take Anything Personally, Don't Make Assumptions, Always Do Your Best. I like how its boiled down to key takeaways so you don't have to highlight the whole book haha. The wise words author offers is something we all know but sometimes forget in the hustle of everyday life. It is good to be reminded about them and think about them consciously. While it sticks to its objectives, the book does go on a tangent, in parts questioning the basic rules on which the human society was built which I am not sure helps the argument. Some of the suggestions come off as high and dry and can be only be implemented if human emotions are out of the equation (which is almost never the case). The good parts of the book can be summarized in a blog which could have been a better medium here. Nevertheless I am happy I read it and got something out of it. Implementation of the author's advices, as is the case with any self-help book, is sort of an iterative process which will go on long after completion of the book.

     Meet #9.<br>
     Genre: Historical Fiction, World War II<br>
     I remember visitng the Holocaust museum in Washington DC and feeling all the horror and hope of the tragic event marked in human history. While it shows us the cruelty humanity is capable of, some stories also give us hope to fight through the darkest times and restore our belief in goodness. I chose this book to live through it and understand it. I hope this will be a quick read compared to my last book ! The to-read list isn't gonna complete itself.
     <br>
     <br>     
     <b>Update:</b> Well that was quick. I had this pent-up energy in me to read stories and having spent last 6 months on a textbook, reading a story is far quicker. After watching the WW2 color documentary on YouTube, I was aware that Nazis had employed some Jews in the camps, but I never knew in what capacity that was done. This story gives an insight into that and it was overall a tough read because.. well.. its about the Auschwitz camp. Seeing the actual photos of the camps is terrifying. It comforts me to know that even in most desperate and tragically unfathomable circumstances, love and hope can be found. It makes one appreciate the life we have right now, even under the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic situation. I read up more about Lale and Gita after finishing the book and I definitely agree that their story needed to be told. At times I felt the characters could have be written more comprehensively, but that doesn’t dent the overall experience too much. I will be reading more stories about WW2 in future for sure.

     Meet #8.<br>
     Genre: Writing<br>
     I follow some channels on Youtube (Lessons from the screenplay, Cinema beyond entertainment) which give excellent analysis of movies and its nuances. I find it highly fascinating. This has been their recommendation for long. Keeping up with the theme of reading outside easy novels, here we go!
     <br>
     <br>     
     <b>Update:</b> I think this might be my biggest achievement till date in terms of pushing through a book. Lots of stuff happened in life which left me little time to read. To be honest, I got lazy at times as well. When I selected this book, I didn't realize how dense it was (it is basically a textbook for screenwriters). I wanted to stick through it and not skip it. I would say it was worth it. I learnt so much about, not only writing, but also about human psyche. Writing a story requires deep awareness of human failings and its struggle. Setting up a character arc or a moral theme of the story pushes you hard to think about the principles your story stands for. It serves a good medium for some self-reflection as well. The book gives you a peak behind the curtain and shows you how the stories are set up. If I watch a movie or read a story these days, I can see through the formulaic structures at times. But it also gives me a new found appreciation for some old classics. As a part of few exercises, I had to watch a few old movies (Casablanca, Toothsie, A Streetcar Named Desire, Meet me in St.Louis, etc to name a few). It is interesting to study different story types (sagas, novels, screenplays and short stories) and their inner workings. I find the science (or may I say art) behind it very powerful. When you look back at life, what is it if not a bunch of stories? The book gets too dense and heavy in parts but delivers on its core premise. I will be revisiting this book time and again when trying to write or understand a story.

     Next up #7.<br>
     Genre: Scifi / Classics<br>
     Heard so many things about this and its derivative work. It has been on my book stand for long judging me while I buy other books. I need a light read now after some serious stuff. The start is hilarious and wit of author is on point!
     <br>
     <br>
     <b>Update:</b> Move over #7. Finished this funny masterpiece! Travelling stuck in trains helps with faster reading speed. Who knew! Very clever writing and sophisticated british humour. It felt like a rick and morty episode with zanny yet reasonable scientific plot points. The extraterrestial poetry was hilarious! It was a great break from serious books to sit and imagine the story in your head, like reading in childhood. Apparently it has 4 more books in series which I will come back to later. Super excited for the movie as well which I did not know existed. On to next!

     Next up #6.<br>
     Genre: Startup / Tech<br>
     I was confused between this and the lean startup. After some feedback, decided to go with this. Let's get some silicon valley gyaan !
     <br>
     <br>
     <b>Update:</b> Finished the 6th. Took quite a while due to distractions like increased work and KDD Conference trip. I thought it was a good read and an insightful take on startups. All the chapters don't necessarily align with each other but as the author states it, the book is translation of his survey course at Stanford. I found the chapter on SECRETS particularly good. For early stage founders, this is a must have. Some quirks like insights from Paypal journey, the Chinese-US comparison for progress with sustainibility, fiirst principles approach to everything and female third person choice were interesting!. On and upwards !

     Next up #5. Genre: Self-help. About time I got through this. The start looks promising ! </br>
     <br>
     <b>Update:</b> Finished the fifth! Better completion time on this one. Easily the best therapy available for 10$ :) . Precise and simple. Not any frameworks or categories to follow as such (which is something lots of self-help books are guilty of). This is the kind of book where you make side notes and keep coming back to it.The author tries to cover all the major stuff in a conversational manner. Had a few epiphanies while going through. Highly recommended. Awesome stuff and on to next !

     <b>Update:</b> Finished the fourth. Exploring new genres can be exhausting ! Started out slow but ended on a high. Very poigant character.Turns out emotions are the same across all spectrum. Coming off age @50 + travel around the world. Loved the different cultures and experiences way of story. Good stuff !

     <br>
     <b>Update:</b> Finished it. One of the best books I have read in a while. Absolutely fascinated with the story. Everyone needs an Atticus Finch in their lives. Now looking forward to catch it on Broadway with screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and Jeff Daniels as Atticius Finch ! I was not aware it was also made into a Academy award winning film as well.

     <br>
     <b>Update:</b> Finally completed it. Took more than 2 months due to its dense nature of so much thought provoking content but pushed through it. You get a dose of every academia under the sun. Starts magnificently but I felt it strays sometimes a bit and uses anecdotal evidence. Nevertheless it is a brave book when it comes to laying out vision of the future of humanity and who else better than the guy who captured mankind's history in his previous book Sapiens.

     First Up. Heard a lot about the writer. Need to start somewhere. Big expectations!<br>
     <br>
     <b>Update:</b> Finished the first ! Hard to find time with all the moving around. This was definitely a new experience. A bit different from my usual reading in a good way. The book pulls you in and takes you on a surreal ride with talking cats and alternate reality. The core story holds up and its hard to stay away from book with a magical-realism based plot. Murakami is on my to-read list now.
